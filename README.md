**Wishlists**

Create Wishlists to track and plan the places you'd like to go and the things you'd like to see and experience.  Start small with your first list, choosing a title (*think New York City, or Phototrip*), picking a category (*museums, restaurants - anything you'd like to group*) and then add the first item - you've got a wishlist started!  

From the Wishlists screen you can see at a glance all of lists you've created, with a quick overview of useful information including how many categories and individual items each list contains.  Here you can also add to an existing list or create a brand new Wishlist.

**Journal**

While Wishlists are a great way to plan ahead for upcoming trips or simply keep track of quick notes, Journals allow you to create longer and more free-form entries.  Just got back from a day exploring a new city?  Save your thoughts and note in a new Journal entry!  

Over time, your Journal will grow to become a record of all the Adventures you've been on and allow you to relive these experiences just as you did the first time.

**Inspiration**

Part of the excitement of planning your next trip is knowing what you have to look forward to, and this is where the Inspiration comes into play.  A quick search feature lets you browse gorgeous photos pulled directly from Flickr - use these to find areas to explore and new items to add to your Wishlists!
